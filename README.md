<h3>Weather Dashboard</h3>
<br>
Created using JS and Ajax to retrieve and display live weather data from OpenWeatherMap.org. While revising this project to accomodate any location the user selects I had to learn about streams. While they made my code slightly more complicated, turns out they're pretty handy and the basis of streaming sites like YouTube. The Mapbox API is a comprehensive and aesthetically pleasing option for a map on the frontend.
